# Artifact 5/6
- The game was relatively well done, but I felt as though there was more that could have been done to make it just a little bit better 
# Paradata 5/5
- Excellently written up paradata, showing an indept analysis of what was learnt in class and relating it back to the what was created
# Biography / Bibliography 2/2
- not much was changed from the previous module, but it was still well done
# Active Listening, attention in lectures, collaborative reading 4.5/5
