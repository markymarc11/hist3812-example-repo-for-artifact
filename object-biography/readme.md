# Object Biography


The Government of Canada issued the construction of the Terry Fox Statue in 1983 by artist John Hooper and was originally unveiled on September 17 of that year at the intersection of Wellington Street and Colonel By Drive.  On July 1, 1998, as part of the Path of Heroes initiative that was created to commemorate the national heroes of Canada, the Terry Fox Statue was relocated to 90 Wellington Street in front of the Parliament Buildings (Ebner, 1998). 

Terrance Stanley Fox (Terry) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba but raised in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia.  In 1977 at the age of 18, Terry was diagnosed with bone cancer and doctors were forced to amputate his right leg 15 centimeters above the knee (Martha, 2017).  In 1979 Terry began to start training to run across Canada on what he called his Marathon of Hope (Martha, 2017).  On April 12, 1980, the dream became a reality, as Terry dipped his artificial leg into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of St Johns, Newfoundland and set off on his journey. On average Terry would run 42 kilometers per day and would be accompanied by his best friend Doug Alward who would drive behind Terry (Martha, 2017). Unfortunately just mere moments away from Thunder Bay on September 1, 1980, Terry stopped running and asked to go to a hospital.  Terry’s refusal to go back to the cancer treatment centre came back to bite him.  Doctors in Thunder Bay determined that the cancer had reappeared in Terry’s lungs and he was forced to put his Marathon of Hope on hold (Martha, 2017). 

Terry Fox never did recover from his cancer and passed away by his family on June 28, 1981 at the age of 22.  Terry’s story captured the attention of the nation and he was named Newsmaker of the Year for 1980 and 1981 (Perrone, 2013: 2).  The attention that Terry received for his actions transformed him into a Canadian icon and he was awarded the Order of Canada on September 18th, 1980, and received British Columbia’s highest honour, the Order of Dogwood, on October 21st, 1980 (Perrone, 2013: 14-15).  Terry’s hard work paid off and by February 17th, 1981 his Marathon of Hope was able to raise approximately 24 million in total, achieving the goal of raising $1 for every Canadian and consisting mainly of private donations (Martha, 2017).
